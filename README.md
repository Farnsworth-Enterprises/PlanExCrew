# PlanExCrew

PlanExCrew is a web-based application inspired by the animated series Futurama. It allows users to assemble a crew of up to three members to undertake various missions, each with a specified difficulty level. By evaluating each potential crew member's rating, users can strategically select the most suitable team to successfully complete missions.

## Features
- Crew Selection: Choose from a list of potential crew members, each with unique ratings indicating their competencies.​

- Mission Assignment: Engage in missions with varying difficulty levels, requiring strategic crew assembly for successful completion.​

- Outcome Evaluation: Receive results based on the combined competency of the selected crew members relative to the mission's difficulty.
